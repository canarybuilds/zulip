# Joining a Feniks Chat organization

By default, Feniks Chat organizations require an invitation to join.

Organization owners can also allow anyone to join without an
invitation, and/or restrict user email addresses to a company domain. See
[inviting new users](/help/invite-new-users).

## Check if you need an invitation to join

## Accept an invitation

Invitations to Feniks Chat organizations often come by email. Look for an email
from Feniks Chat. It may take a few minutes for the invitation email to reach your
inbox.

Alternatively, an organization administrator may have sent you an invitation
link via another method.

## Tips

* If you are joining multiple Feniks Chat organizations, we recommend
  using the [Feniks Chat Desktop app](../apps). The desktop app makes it easy to
  [switch between different organizations](/help/switching-between-organizations).

* If your company uses single sign-on (SSO) authentication for Feniks Chat,
  these instructions may not apply. Try going to your company's Feniks Chat URL
  to see if there are instructions there; otherwise contact your manager
  or IT department for company-specific instructions.
